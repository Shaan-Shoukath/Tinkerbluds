# Tinkerbluds — Cultivated Land Validation Platform

An **API-ready plot validation service** powered by **Google Earth Engine**, **Sentinel-2** satellite imagery, **ESA WorldCover** land classification, **Open-Meteo** weather & soil data, and **Supabase** for persistent farmer/plot storage.

Upload a KML polygon → get an instant validation score covering plot existence, agricultural land classification, crop plausibility, and supporting evidence layers — all through a REST API or interactive dashboard.

### `POST /confirm_plot` — Save to Supabase

Called when the user confirms "Yes, this is my plot." Only **PASS** or **REVIEW** plots can be saved — FAIL is rejected with HTTP 400.

**Request:**

```json
{
  "farmer_name": "Rajan Kumar",
  "farmer_phone": "+919876543210",
  "farmer_email": "rajan@email.com",
  "plot_label": "Paddy Field North",
  "polygon_geojson": {"type": "Polygon", "coordinates": [[[76.1, 10.2], ...]]},
  "kml_data": "<?xml ...>",
  "area_acres": 10.0,
  "cultivated_percentage": 70.0,
  "ndvi_mean": 0.72,
  "decision": "PASS",
  "confidence_score": 0.85
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "farmer_id": "uuid-...",
  "plot_id": "uuid-...",
  "message": "Plot saved successfully!",
  "has_overlap_warning": false,
  "overlaps": []
}
```

> **Area adjustment:** The stored area = `area_acres × cultivated_percentage / 100`. A 10-acre plot at 70% green stores as **7 acres**.

> **Overlap detection:** If the new plot overlaps any existing plot by > 5%, an alert is created and the response includes overlap details.

---

### `GET /admin/alerts?resolved=false` — Overlap Alerts

Returns all unresolved overlap alerts with linked plot/farmer data.

### `POST /admin/alerts/{alert_id}/resolve` — Resolve Alert

Marks an overlap alert as resolved.

### Formulas

| Metric                  | Formula                                                        |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cultivated %**        | (Cropland ∩ Active Vegetation) / Total Plot Area × 100         |
| **Confidence Score**    | 0.7 × cultivated% + 0.3 × mean NDVI                            |
| **Overall (with crop)** | 0.8 × confidence + 0.2 × yield_feasibility                     |
| **Crop Suitability**    | 25% temp + 25% rain + 10% humidity + 15% soil + 25% vegetation |
| **Estimated Yield**     | baseline_yield × overall_suitability                           |

### Decision Thresholds

| Decision   | Condition            | Can Save to Supabase? |
| ---------- | -------------------- | --------------------- |
| **PASS**   | cultivated% > 60%    | ✅ Yes                |
| **REVIEW** | cultivated% ≤ 60%    | ✅ Yes                |
| **FAIL**   | No cropland detected | ❌ Blocked            |

### Crop Unsuitability

If a crop's overall suitability score falls below **40%**, it is flagged as **"Not Recommended"** with specific reasons:

- 🌡️ _"Temperature too hot for Cardamom — needs 15–25°C, got 32°C"_
- 🌧️ _"Rainfall too low for Rice — needs 1500–3000mm, got 80mm"_
- 🏜️ _"Soil too dry for Pepper — needs 0.25–0.45 m³/m³, got 0.12"_

## Yield Feasibility & Crop Recommendations

When a `claimed_crop` is provided, the system:

1. Looks up the crop's ideal growing conditions from a **Kerala-specific dataset** (20 crops)
2. Fetches the **last 90 days of real weather + soil moisture** from the [Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/)
3. Compares 5 parameters: temperature, rainfall, humidity, **soil moisture (0-7cm)**, and NDVI
4. Estimates yield as `baseline × overall_suitability`
5. Flags crops scoring below 40% as **unsuitable** with specific reasons

Crop recommendations are always generated (no `claimed_crop` needed) — all 20 crops are scored and the top 5 are returned.

### Supported Crops (Kerala Region)

| Category   | Crops                                                                |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Food       | Rice, Tapioca, Banana, Maize                                         |
| Plantation | Coconut, Rubber, Tea, Coffee, Arecanut, Cashew                       |
| Spices     | Pepper, Cardamom, Ginger, Turmeric, Nutmeg, Clove, Vanilla, Cinnamon |
| Other      | Sugarcane, Groundnut                                                 |

---

## Overlap Detection

When a plot is saved to Supabase:

1. Its GeoJSON polygon is compared **geometrically** (Shapely) against all existing saved plots
2. If intersection area / new plot area ≥ **5%**, an alert is created
3. The frontend shows an overlap warning banner + "Report to Admin" email button
4. Admin can view/resolve alerts via `GET /admin/alerts`
